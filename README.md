Report

A. Methodologies  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Data Sources: For my project I used the Landsat/MS (ImageServer). The data from my images come from the Multispectral Landsat image service, which covers the land mass of the world. The data includes scenes from the Landsat 8 and Global Land Survey (GLS) data from epochs 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010 at 30 meter resolution and GLS 1975 at 60 meter resolution. The data sets were created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) using Landsat images (ArcGIS). I added this server in ArcGIS Pro under Insert, Connections, New ArcGIS Server.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landsat 8 was launched February 11, 2013. This satellite carries the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) instruments. The OLI measures waves in the visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared portions of the spectrum (bands 1-9). The TIRS measures land surface temperature in two thermal bands (bands 10-11) with a technology that uses quantum physics to detect heat. The Landsat 8 completes one earth orbit every 99 minutes and has a 16 day repeat cycle (USGS).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landsat 8 is passive remote sensing technology. Landsat satellites are passive sensors because they only measure radiation that is emitted by the sun and reflected or re-emitted back from the earth. Reflected energy can only be measured when the sun is present, but for re-emitted energy, such as thermal infrared, it can be detected day or night, as long as enough energy is stored in order to for it to be recorded (Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, 2003).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Data Collection Platform: The data collection platform was very easy to utilize once I added it as a New ArcGIS Server. It took about an hour to download, but it produced high quality images. Another positive aspect of this data source was that Landsat has data from 1975 until now, which was important because I needed to produce maps from 1990-2010. It was easy and convenient to use the time bar in ArcGIS to scroll to what time period I wanted, apply the processing template that I wanted, and export the map as a layout. A couple of disadvantages of Landsat is that it can only take images during the day, and it cannot penetrate cloud cover, so clouds can affect the visibility of these images (PennState, 2020). With a large timeline to choose from, it was easy to find images that were not covered in clouds. Los Angeles tends to have more sunny skies than other cities do, so that was also to my advantage.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Data Resolution: This data was at 30 meters resolution (ArcGIS). At this resolution, two objects that are 30 meters long or wide, sitting side by side, can be separated (resolved) on a Landsat image (URI). I think that 30 meter resolution is great for this project because it takes a decent amount of time to download (around 30 minutes to 1 hour) but wouldn’t take as long as something at a 1 meter resolution would take. ArcGIS Pro has a lot of options under the Appearance Tab to manipulate the data in order to make it clear and easy to read and to interpret the data, so even if the image isn’t perfect at first, it can be manipulated to look better. Landsat imagery 30 meter resolution data is also cheaper to capture, process, and distribute than something like 1 meter resolution would be (HSU, 2018).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv: Data Accuracy: I believe this data is accurate because it comes from a reliable source. The source came from ArcGIS.com, and was comprised of data created by the USGS and NASA, which are highly credible government sources. I figured that the 30 meter resolution provided by the Landsat 8 would be a decent size to analyze something as large as the city. Before committing to using this as my resource for my project, I tested it out by downloading the data, zooming into Los Angeles, and seeing if I could produce quality maps by trying out different color templates.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. Band Length: For my first combination of bands, I chose natural color; red, green, and blue (bands 4, 3, 2). These bands are in the visible portion of the wavelength spectrum. For Landsat 8, the red band (band 4) has a wavelength of 0.64-0.67 micrometers. The green band (band 3) has a wavelength of 0.53-0.59 micrometers. The blue band (band 2) has a wavelength of 0.45-0.51 micrometers (USGS). I chose this band combination because it’s on the visible spectrum and would mimic what a human would see. Under this combination, healthy vegetation is green, unhealthy vegetation appears brown, urban features are white and gray, and water is dark blue or black (GISGeography, (2021). While many urban, vegetation, and hydrological changes can be observed under this band combination, I decided that this band combination would be my designated one to showcase urban change. While I could have chosen other combinations to observe urban change, I thought that this one showed it nicely by being able to observe the expansion and the changes in density of the gray and white areas of the map. I also like how it’s what the human eye sees, and shows a great blueprint of contrast for my next two false color combinations.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my second combination of bands, I chose color infrared; near infrared, red, and green (bands 5, 4, 3). While bands 4 and 3 are in the visible spectrum, the near infrared (band 5) is not, and is in the reflected infrared portion of the wavelength spectrum. For Landsat 8, the near infrared band (band 5) has a wavelength of 0.85-0.88 micrometers (USGS) which is invisible to the human eye. This band combination is useful for analyzing vegetation health, so I thought that it would be perfect to analyze environmental/vegetation changes. Chlorophyll reflects near infrared and green light while absorbing red light. Since it reflects more near infrared than green, plants appear red (NASA, 2014). The higher the concentration of chlorophyll, the healthier the plant, and the deeper red it will appear under this band combination. Under this band combination, urban areas appear white and water appears dark (GIS Geography, 2021). While using this band combination, it is so easy to illustrate the changes in plant health over time while looking at the various shades of red and red-brown.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my third combination of bands, I chose the false color combination of shortwave infrared-1, near infrared, and green (bands 6, 5, 3). For Landsat 8, the shortwave infrared-1 band (band 6) has a wavelength of 1.57-1.65 micrometers. The near infrared band (band 5) has a wavelength of 0.85-0.88 micrometers, and the green band (band 3) has a wavelength of 0.53-0.59 micrometers (USGS). Bands 6 and 5 are in the reflected infrared portion of the spectrum, and band 3 is in the visible portion of the spectrum. Water absorbs all three of these wavelengths, so it appears black under this combination (NASA, 2014). Since there’s little water in Los Angeles to begin with, I thought this color combination would be useful to best isolate the water and to be able to compare the hydrological changes over time.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi: Color Contrast: One reason I liked this data source was that it contained several processing templates to choose from, instead of having to change the bands manually. At first I chose natural color, infrared color, and false color because I thought that each one would cover the urban, environmental, and hydrological changes of the city nicely. For the false color template, I chose “None” as the processing template and then inputted the bands myself under RBG Symbology, since it wasn’t already a template. While those processing templates produced okay results, I noticed that the maps were even clearer when I added DRA, dynamic range adjustment, to them. The DRA helped to add contrast to the maps and to be able to see more detailed changes. Natural and infrared templates had ones with DRA built in, and I added DRA manually to the custom false color template. I played around with different Resampling Types, but decided that the default Bilinear produced the best results. I tried different Stretch Types, but also decided to keep that at Minimum Maximum. Lastly, I kept the Enhancement features at the default, and did not change the Brightness, Contrast, or Gamma.  
B. Results  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Imagery Analysis:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Environmental: I can observe several environmental changes in all of my maps. One that’s evident in all of the band combinations is that the area of the Angeles National Forest, located in the northern part of the city, has shrunk in overall size. Another environmental impact that I can see thanks to infrared light, is the health of the vegetation. Over the last 30 years, the earth’s temperature has gotten hotter. Because of that, droughts and forest fires have become even more apparent in cities like Los Angeles and the areas surrounding them. This has had an impact on plant health, and there’s a stark difference between the level of red, healthy vegetation in 1990 and the more dull red vegetation in 2010 in all areas of the city, but especially in the Angeles National Forest.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Urban: Urban change is evident in all three band combinations that I used. In natural color, you can see how the gray urban areas become darker and more condensed over time. In the color infrared, you can see how the gray/light blue urban areas are more contained in 1990, but start encroaching on the red vegetation areas, and start washing them out in 2000 and then even more in 2010. In the false color, it’s evident that the purple urban areas become a lot more dense and concentrated in the center of the city as the years go on. While most of the city was already built by 1990, you can see a slight increase in both the area and the density of urban areas over the 30 years by looking at the different band combinations.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Hydrological: The hydrological changes are a little difficult to observe in the first two maps, but it is really evident in the last false color band combination. In 1990, I see really intense and concentrated black bodies of water scattered around the city, and then by 2010, they are more blurry and transparent. With climate change leading to droughts, it makes sense that the few bodies of water located in Los Angeles would be not as plentiful with water as they once were. I can also observe that the shoreline has changed. The ocean takes up more space on the map from 1990 to 2010. The actual coastline itself also appears to be less rigid and more blurry in 2010 than in 1990. With sea levels rising on average 3.6 millimeters/0.14 inches a year (The Royal Society, 2020), it makes sense that there would be some subtle but noticeable changes in the coastline.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Challenges: Although this data source was very convenient to use, using the scroll bar was a little challenging at times. I could not choose a specific month out of the year like I could by using a platform like GloVis; it had to be within a range of time. I’d scroll to different times on the scroll bar timeline and it would show up black. I think I was still able to get images that were approximately around the epochs they were supposed to be. During this project, I learned that when making multiple maps it’s way easier and less time consuming to make a new layout, export it, and then use the same template (title, description, legend, scale bar, etc., with changes) as the older layout to make the next map. Starting from scratch each time and making a new layout takes more time and it’s harder to get all of the map features in the same place. I think that because of using the same layout but editing it each time, my maps look uniform and professional. Having all of the map features the same font, size, and in the exact same space, makes it easier to focus all of the attention on the different band combinations. I didn’t face many other challenges and thought that the assignments for the class prepared me for what I needed to do in order to make my map series.
